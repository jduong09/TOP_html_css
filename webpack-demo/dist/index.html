  <!-- Install Lodedash from website -->
  <!--
    Problems with managing Javascript projects this way:

      - It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
      - If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not work properly.
      - If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.
      - No global scope pollution
